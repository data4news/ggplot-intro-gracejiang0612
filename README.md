# Plotting distributions with ggplot

## Learning Objectives

- [ ] Know how to make a plot in `ggplot` that plots a single variable in a DataFrame (notebooks 1 & 2)
- [ ] Understand what a distribution is and the various ways to visualize one (notebooks 1 & 2)
- [ ] Be aware of the pipe (`%>%`) syntax in the tidyverse R package and understand what it does (notebook 3)

## Files

- `notebook-1.ipynb` - plotting poverty rates of zipcodes in NYC as univariate distributions in ggplot
- `notebook-2.ipynb` - plotting poverty rates of zipcodes in NYC by borough
- `notebook-3.ipynb` - compare the summary statistics (median, mean, stdev) to the exploratory viz, learn a tiny bit more R syntax

## Quickstart
(In case you haven't already installed this stuff!)

A Jupyter notebook that mixes Python3 and R.
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dmil/jupyter-quickstart/blob/master/notebook.ipynb

```
brew install r
brew install libgit2
RScript setup.R
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch the notebook in jupyter like this `jupyter notebook notebook-1.ipynb` or in VSCode with `code .`
